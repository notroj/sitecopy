sitecopy allows you to easily maintain remote Web sites.  The program
will upload files to the server which have changed locally, and delete
files from the server which have been removed locally, to keep the
remote site synchronized with the local site, with a single
command. sitecopy will also optionally try to spot files you move
locally, and move them remotely. FTP, WebDAV and HTTP-based authoring
servers are supported.

sitecopy is designed to not care about what is actually on the remote
server - it simply keeps a record of what it THINKS is in on the
remote server, and work from that.
