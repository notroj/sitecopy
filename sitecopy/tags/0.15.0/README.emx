README for the EMX Port
=======================

To build the sitecopy executable with EMX 0.9d, just run GNU make on
Makefile.emx:

make -f Makefile.emx


The ported sitecopy was successfully tested with FTP using the OS/2
ftpd. I have no idea whether WebDAV works, thus it is disabled in the
Makefile.


You need the EMX Runtime 0.9d (or later) to run sitecopy with OS/2.

It is also possible to use the executable with Windows9x/NT, if you
have RSXNT 1.42 (or later) installed.


The latest EMX Runtime is available from the following URL:
ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/02-emx-runtime.zip

RSXNT 1.42 is available from this URL:
ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/emx+gcc/rsxnt/rsxrt142.zip
