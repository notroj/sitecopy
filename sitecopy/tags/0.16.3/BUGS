From Jan Hendrik Schreier:

no display of protocol in standard banner line is confusing.

SEGTERM during a --fetch gets a SIGSEGV

Bugs in 0.11.4:

- MacOS X 10.1 catchup/sitecopy not recording times properly doesn't
 *** possibly CPP fileset.h duplication bug
- FTP fetch mode does MDTM for each file when 0.10.x didn't and is hence 
very slow for large sites (Dave Hollis)
- rm foo; --synch brings back foo with 1970-01-01 modtime (Dave Hollis)

From Kobaz Mi'Daire:

If there is an "&" in a directory name on the remote end and you do a
sitecopy -f, then try to preform a sync operation on the site, either
using -u or -s, sitecopy thinks the directory has not been created, trys
to create it, and fails because it already exists.
 
Also if a directory on the remote end is all caps, this problem shows up
as well.

Currently, it looks like there are things that sitecopy silently
ignores if it doesn't understand. For example, I had this:

    exclude     Queries/makeTSV
    exclude     Queries/makeMatrix
    exclude     Queries/doReduce

That was wrong; missing a leading slash. It should be:

    exclude     /Queries/makeTSV
    exclude     /Queries/makeMatrix
    exclude     /Queries/doReduce

But sitecopy didn't let me know that those excludes were being ignored.

From: "Pascal Ung":

trying not to use clear password inside .sitecopyrc
(preferring, user and password challenge)

we found that it doesn't work in the following case:

 the .htaccess contains kind of:

 <Limit PROPFIND PUT DELETE PATCH PROPPATCH MKCOL COPY MOVE LOCK UNLOCK>
    require user webmaster enduser
</Limit>
<Files ~ "^\.ht">
 Order deny,allow
 Deny from all
 Allow from  .userdomain.fr
 require user webmaster
</Files>

Subject: [sitecopy] large files
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2005 17:00:07 +0200

To get support for large files I've used following compile option as
suggested in previous thread:

export CFLAGS="-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64"

But I also had to tweak 'src/sitestore.c' to avoid "filezize overflow"

Sitecopy has supported scp/sftp modes of transfer for a while now, however
the manual page has no information on how to make it all work.
