   been disabled for this release.
* Updated Czech translation (cs.po) from Petr Prazak.

Changes in release 0.10.3
* Updated German translation (de.po) from Thomas Schultz.
* Updated neon to 0.7.0.

* Build fix for cygwin, which lacks regex.h.
* Synch mode will just set permissions of local files if the file 
  contents have not changed.
* Console: synch mode will refuse to just remove all files in the local 
  site, since new users sometimes confuse --update with --synch, with 
  disastrous consequences. Use 'rm' if you need this functionality.
* Console: The --debug/-d option now takes comma-separated strings 
  rather numbers, e.g. 'sitecopy --debug=http,socket --fetch mysite'
* Added German translation (de.po) from Thomas Schultz <tststs@gmx.de>.
* WebDAV fetch mode re-implemented.
* Fix for downloading files in DAV driver.
* neon updates to 0.4.x:
  - Basic SSL support added to DAV driver (requires OpenSSL)... use
    'configure --with-ssl', then put 'http secure' in the rcfile
    entry for the site.
    IMPORTANT NOTE: server certificates are NOT presented for user
    verification (yet).
* Protocol name for WebDAV driver in rcfile is now 'webdav' or 
  'dav', e.g. 'protocol dav'
  The old value, 'http' is recognized but deprecated.
* WebDAV driver will refuse to operate against a server which does
  not identify itself as a class 1 WebDAV server in an OPTIONS response.
* FTP fetch mode will skip Windows drive specifications in directory
  names.
* Console: more signals handled by saving update state.

Changes in release 0.10.0-beta
* HACK: New protocol driver: uses rcp and rsh in combination.
  Use 'protocol rsh'. Requires a WORKING rsh/rcp setup to the server.
* Option to disable FTP support added to configure: --disable-ftp
* Support interactive prompting for username/password: can omit these
  from rcfile.
* HTTP proxy authentication support: "proxy-username" and "proxy-password"
  rcfile keywords (or omit these and use interactive prompting).
* Switch to using 'neon' WebDAV client library (http://www.webdav.org/neon/):
  - Support for libxml as XML parser (version 1.8.3 or later required).
  - Proper error messages for 207 error responses.
  - RFC2616 and RFC2518 compliance fixes.
  - Temporarily dropped support for authoring via non-WebDAV extended HTTP 
    (WebRFM, Netscape Enterprise, AOLserver etc)... will return later.
* WebDAV: Can maintain file execute permissions against mod_dav 0.9.17 or 
  later: 'permissions exec' is allowed for DAV sites.
* Synch mode will only connect to the server if necessary.
* Sensible abort handling (CTRL-C to abort).
* Fix builds on Solaris 7 etc which have a libintl.
* Console: --view mode will only display named sites if any sites are
  named.
* Console: Storage file is opened before update begins to help prevent
  loss of update results.

* Use timeout-based read_line again (as per 0.7.6 and earlier).

Changes in release 0.9.1
* Move files remotely before uploading new files.
* Niall Smart <niall@pobox.com> fixed --flatlist output.

Changes in release 0.9.0

 *** The info files (~/.sitecopy/*) written by this version are NOT
 *** backward compatible - versions 0.8.x and before will NOT read
 *** them. You are advised to take a backup copy of your ~/.sitecopy/
 *** directory before installing this version.
 *** 0.9.0 will read the info files written by previous versions.

 *** If you use 'permissions all', then after upgrading, all existing
 *** files will be appear 'changed'. Run sitecopy --catchup with the
 *** new version to mark them as updated. The same applies for those
 *** who use 'permissions exec'.

 * Major redesign. This brings:

  - Improved handling of file permissions - changes in just
    permissions are detected and handled by update mode. Fetch mode
    can retrieve the permissions of remote files, and synch mode will
    set them locally.

  - Better handling of ASCII files - if you change whether a file is
    ASCII or not, files will be marked as changed accordingly.

  - Detect file content changes by MD5 checksumming, rather than by
    modification time / size - use the `state checksum' option.

  - Handling of moved files improved: the overhead previously incurred
    by checking for moved files should be greatly reduced. New option
    to check for renamed files too - `checkmoved renames' (only valid
    in conjuction with the `state checksum' option.

 * Site storage files (~/.sitecopy/*) are now XML, allowing for easy
 future extension.

 * 'ignore' option added, syntax as per 'exclude', which means that
 changes to local files which match any of the 'ignore' patterns are
 not mirrored to the remote site by update mode. Files which match
 'ignore' patterns will still be created, deleted and moved as normal.

 * The 'ascii' keyword now has syntax as per 'exclude', and is not
 limited to 20 entries.

 * New option 'lowercase', which forces all filenames to be converted
 to lowercase for use on the remote site.

 * "Safe mode" added, using the 'safe' option. See the man page for
 details of this option. Thanks to Shaun Steinhorst for the idea.

 * Synch mode will download deleted files even when 'nodelete' is used.

 * Number of directories that can be scanned in local sites is limited
 only by virtual memory size. 

 * Console frontend: update mode signal handling changed. SIGINT
 (e.g. CTRL-C) will now safely terminate the update, saving the update 
 progress. Other termination signals cause an immediate quit, without
 saving the update progress: use SIGQUIT (e.g. CTRL-\) if you want this.

 * Console frontend: new --show-progress option to display progress
 of data transfer in update mode.

 * Internationalization: Russian translation from Michael Sobolev.

 * 'tempupload' option to upload changed files to a temporary file, 
 '.in.filename' then rename to 'filename' when the upload is complete.

 * Added 'Expect: 100-continue' option again, in the form of an 
 *enabling* option 'http expect'. Users of Apache 1.3.9 and above are
 advised to use this option, since it will save time and bandwidth.

 * Added 'ftp showquit' option to display QUIT message from FTP server.

 * GNOME frontend update from Lee Mallabone: unfinished code, use with
 care. Backup your rcfile! The site info writing code has not been
 tested very much at all, so whatever you do, make sure your rcfile is
 safe somewhere else before trying this release.
 
  - The site/file tree received a complete rewrite and now appears
  lovely and stable, and represents files/directories as it should
  do.
 
  - Fetch mode. Not perfect, but it's built the best way it can be
  given the API, and does seem to work reliably.

  - Update; I've added a "stop" button to the update dialog that
  appears when an update is in progress. It has issues at the moment,
  I believe; unfortunately I haven't had much time to test it, so your
  mileage may vary.  Updates themselves should still work just fine
  though.

  - Site creation; as you'll see from clicking 'new site', this part
  of the app has also been totally rewritten. *sigh* it's another
  unfinished feature though. The druid looks very nice, imho. But I've
  not yet added the code to actually create sites.

  - Site editing; the GUI is totally rewritten from 0.8.x, but parts
  of it are not yet hooked up, so you may experience some "race
  conditions".

Changes in release 0.8.3

 * Minor Makefile fix.

Changes in release 0.8.2

 * GNOME frontend: Fixed a reported bug with using "always keep going"
 to update remote sites (Lee Mallabone).

Changes in release 0.8.1

 * Minor cosmetic change to console frontend: display remote root in
 banner lines too.

 * Slight speed optimisation.

 * GNOME file reorganisation (Lee Mallabone).

Changes in release 0.8.0

 * Updated EMX build to include WebDAV code (Steffen Siebert).

 * Fix for non-WebDAV builds (Steffen Siebert).

 * GNOME: New upload dialog (Lee Mallabone).

Changes in release 0.8.0pre2

 * WebDAV: Disabled '100-expect' completely, always, for safety.
 This feature will be brought back later as an option which defaults
 to "off".

 * configure fix to find 'xmlparse.h' in /usr/include/xmltok/ as 
 per Debian's libxmltok1-dev package.

Changes in release 0.8.0pre

 * Fixed bug which caused hostname lookup, connection and
 authentication errors to be ignored.
 
 * Fix for finding expat in 'xmltok' and 'xmlparse' libraries.

  - Redesigned quit dialog. No more dialogs popping up over each other.
  - Improved error handling.
  - WebDAV options added to interface.

Changes in release 0.7.10

 * Disallow using permissions support for WebDAV sites (prevents
 segfault mid-update).

 * Rename of send_file, hopefully improves AIX 4.3 build.

Changes in release 0.7.9

 * Added check for expat in -lxmltok and -lxmlparse as per
 Debian's libxmltok1 package.

 * console: Null-terminate long options array.

 * Added implicit rule for object file compilation, should fix build
 with non-GNU make.

 * Possible fix for cygwin WebDAV upload problems.

Changes in release 0.7.8

 * Added errno.h include in src/socket.c.

Changes in release 0.7.7

 * Added 'http limit' option to try only one request per connection.

 * read_line reverted to use recv() directly.

 * Bug fix where uploads will continue till end-of-file rather than
 a fixed number of bytes.

Changes in release 0.7.6

 * WebDAV: auth memory allocation tidyup, proxy support fixed,
 succeed on delete directory for any non-207 2xx class response.

 * Remove segfault on finding named pipes etc, in local directories 
 with debugging turned on.
 
 * FTP transfer type set when appropriate after broken connection -
 patch by Tim Ricketts <tr@oxlug.org>.

 * Extra debugging messages in FTP, WebDAV and socket code.

 * Minor man page update.

Changes in release 0.7.5

 * HTTP Basic auth fix, and response body with set Content-Length
 download fix.

Changes in release 0.7.4

 * console: Change to "sitecopy: Site `foo'..." line, now displays 
 mode name, site name, and remote server host only.

 * Experimental support for HTTP proxying - use, e.g.:
    proxy-server proxy.myserver.com
    proxy-port 8080
 in rcfile to enable.

 * Fall back on hardcoded port numbers if service name isn't known.

 * Complete rewrite of HTTP Authentication code, to the new RFC 2617
 standard. The new code has support for:
  - MD5-session algorithm
  - Digest code supports 'qop=auth-int' message integrity (untested)
  - understands multiple challenges in 401 response, uses Digest 
    in preference to Basic
  - interprets the 'Authentication-Info' header, and authenticates
    server response accordingly
  Tested against Apache 1.3.6 with the new mod_digest (still
  works against old RFC 2069-style server implementations, too).

 * Cleanups to HTTP code.

 * FTP Passwords and the HTTP 'Authorization:' header value are 
 now hidden in debugging output.

Changes in release 0.7.3

 * New 'http noexpect' option to workaround problems with WebDAV 
 servers which do not correctly handle the HTTP/1.1 
 'Expect: 100-continue' header (e.g. Apache <= 1.3.6).

Changes in release 0.7.2

 * GNOME error handling bugfix (Lee Mallabone)

 * Compile fix for cygwin environment, thanks to Andy Cowling.

Changes in release 0.7.1

 * Fixed lib/snprintf.c compilation (Andy Cowling)

Changes in release 0.7.0

 *** Name mapping has been removed - the 'rename' key is no longer
 *** valid in the rcfile

 * Enhanced exclude syntax, allows specific directories to be
 ignored, e.g. 'exclude /foo/bar' to exclude foo/bar, or
 'exclude /foo/bar/*.bak' similarly.

 * Socket reads will timeout, so the program will not hang
 indefinitely on a severe protocol error.

 * Console: Added --keep-going option to force an update to
 continue past errors. Faster startup (probably).

 * WebDAV: Filenames with non-alphanumeric characters in
 work now. Fetch mode memory consumption drastically improved. Better
 RFC2068 compliance.

 * FTP: Fetch and synch modes will work when 'ftp nopasv' is specified
 too - fixed by Paul Crowley <paul@hedonism.demon.co.uk>. File
 permissions are maintained in nooverwrite mode - fixed by Olivier Calle 
 <olivier@calle.org>.

 * GNOME changes from Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>:
  - All new site creation wizard. Seems stable, but it is new code so please
    test & report any shortcomings.
  - Massive memory plugs. Memory usage reduction by nearly an order of
    magnitude. (yea, i bloopered the first time round:)
  - Misc bug fixes. (see gnome/Changelog.xsitecopy for more details).

 * Ported to Digital Unix 4.0 by Dobrica Pavlinusic <dpavlin@foi.hr>.
 Ported to SunOS 4.1 (thanks to Andrew Haylett <ajh@primag.co.uk> and
 fetchmail). Ported to the cygwin environment by Andy Cowling
 <arc@sequent.com>. Generally, quite a lot of portability
 improvements.

 * Added support for SOCKS firewall - thanks to Andrew Haylett.

 * Bug fixes: some memory leaks.

Changes in release 0.6.0

 * Major restructuring of all the WebDAV code, including the
 addition of fetch and synch mode handlers. Fetch mode requires
 expat for XML parsing - see the INSTALL file for details (you 
 can still compile without expat, just you can't use fetch mode)

 * WebDAV code fixed to work with IIS 5 beta - thanks to Jim
 Whitehead for making a server available.

 * Yarom Last <ylast@cco.caltech.edu> extended the HTTP code 
 to work with non-WebDAV HTTP-based authoring servers, i.e.
  - AOLserver and Netscape Enterprise Server which implement
    the 'MKDIR' etc methods
  - Any HTTP server which can transparently create remote dirs
    with PUT requests

 * GNOME frontend changes from Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>:
  - New 'backup' menu for storage and restoration of the rcfile and
    individual site infofiles.
  - Save sites As, option added.
  - More online help.
  - Numerous bug fixes, including a major one - if you've had 
    trouble with XSitecopy before, I encourage you to try this 
    version.

 * FTP: Only execute TYPE when actually needed. Report login
 failure properly.
	
 * Misc bug fixes and tidying
