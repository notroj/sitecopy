# 
# This document gives some example rcfile entries for sitecopy.
# For more detailed documentation, see the man page, sitecopy.1 
# (or run 'man sitecopy').
# 

# Fred's site is uploaded to the FTP server 'my.server.com' and held
# in the directory 'public_html', which is in the login directory. The
# site is stored locally in the directory /home/fred/html.

site mysite
  server my.server.com
  url http://www.server.com/fred
  username fred
  password juniper
  local /home/fred/html/
  remote ~/public_html/

# You can put more site definitions below.
# Make the name of the site (i.e. 'mysite' above) easily
# memorable, since you refer to sites by these names on
# the command line, e.g.:
#    sitecopy --update mysite
# to upload the recent changes to the above site.

# You might want to use both the 'state checksum' and 'checkmoved
# renames' options. This will mean that if you move or rename files
# locally, they will be moved or renamed remotely, too. Using 'state
# checksum' means that every file in your local site is read at
# startup, which will cause a slower startup.

# Here, Freda's site is uploaded to the FTP server 'elsewhere.com',
# where it is held in the (absolute) directory /www/freda/. The local
# site is stored in ~/sites/elsewhere/ (that is, $HOME/sites/elsewhere)

site anothersite
  server elsewhere.com
  username freda
  password blahblah
  local ~/sites/elsewhere/
  remote /www/freda/
  # Use checksumming, and look for moved and renamed files
  state checksum
  checkmoved renames
  # Freda wants files with a .log extension to 
  # excluded from the update
  exclude *.log
  # She also wants any changes to the file 'news.html'
  # in her site to be ignored
  ignore /news.html

# Enough examples yet?
# Here's one for WebDAV:

site joehome
  server dav.wow.com
  protocol webdav
  username pow
  password zap 
  local /home/joe/www/homepage/
  remote /joe/

# That's enough.
#
# All server names and username/passwords given in this
# file are fictitious. Please don't bother trying them.
